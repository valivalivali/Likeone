# Likeone

**Video profile dating app. One like per day.**

Likeone is a dating app where profiles are videos instead of photos. When you join, you record a short video of yourself. This video becomes your profile. Other users do the same, so when you browse the app, you see real videos of real people.

The app limits you to one like per day. You scroll through video profiles and choose who you want to like. If that person also likes you, you become a match and can start chatting. Both people need to like each other to connect.

## Features

- **Video profiles** – record a short video as your profile instead of uploading photos
- **One like per day** – choose one person daily to send your like to
- **Mutual matching** – you only match when both people like each other
- **Chat** – message your matches directly in the app
- **Sign in with Apple** – quick and secure sign up
